# Google Messages 4 Desktop

A simple, cross-platform desktop wrapper for [Google Messages Web](https://messages.google.com/web) with support for tray, notifications, persistent settings, icon themes, auto-updates, and settings backup. For Windows, Linux, and OS X.  Other great repositories exist but this was one I developed using AI as I learn node code.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Auto-launch & tray support
- Desktop notifications
- Custom tray icons
- Persistent settings (window size, theme, etc.)
- Backup & restore settings
- GitHub-based auto-updater
- Multi-platform builds: Windows  (OS X and Linux builds in progress)
- NOTE: These packages are NOT signed.  I don't have the resources to add code signing.  However I'm open to adding this feature if resources allow.
